## Overview

This project involves training two models using two different datasets related to mental health classification.

* **First Model:** Trained on a dataset with approximately 50k rows. It contains user-written texts labeled with tags provided by professionals.
* **Second Model:** Trained on a larger dataset with over 600k rows. The tags are subreddit names.
Both datasets focus on identifying mental health conditions based on text inputs.
